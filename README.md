# Antosser's Plants vs. Zombies MoneyBot

## How to use
First install every module from the requirements.txt file
Then open the "pvz_ls_hack.py" file
Go into plants vs. zombies and make a new last stand game
Then hover your mouse over the places as shown in the picture and press the "insert" key in the correct order
After the second click my bot should automatically pick the correct flowers and press the start button
If the programm crashes you'll need to see the error and fix it
